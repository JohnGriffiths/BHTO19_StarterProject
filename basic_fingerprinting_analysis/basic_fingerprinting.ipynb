    "## A quick primer: Connectivity Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin to talk about how fingerprinting can be done, let's quickly go over **connectivity matrices**. A connectivity matrix in fMRI analysis describes the **connectivity** (read correlation) of two nodes from some fMRI data. Specifically this fMRI data can be in the form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vertices on a surface\n",
    "- A parcel from parcellated fMRI data (this contains the mean time series of that particular parcel)\n",
    "    - Furthermore this parcel can be derived from either surface-based fMRI or volume-based\n",
    "- Voxels from volume-based fMRI data\n",
    "\n",
    "Under ideal circumstances you would use a surface-based parcellation of fMRI data where each parcel is defined as the average time series from a set of vertices \"belonging together\". "

    "## How to compute the identifiability of subject resting state networks (fingerprinting)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have full connectivity matrices of the data, you can now start computing fingerprinting/identifiability scores. The rationale behind this is that given the connectivity matrices of a group of particular individuals across two sessions of fMRI acquisition, individual connectivity matrices should be more ***similar* to themselves compared to others** across sessions. \n",
    "\n",
    "A natural question that arises from the above statement is: *how do we express similarity of functional connectivity matrices*? Here's the authors approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a full connectivity matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://nilearn.github.io/_images/sphx_glr_plot_signal_extraction_001.png\" width=70%/img>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used in Finn et al. (2015) converts this into a *feature vector* (a list of features to describe a single participant) by taking the upper right triangle part of the connectivity matrix. This is because, as shown above, the matrix is symmetric (mirrored) along the diagonal. The data is then normalized using a Fisher $r$-to-$Z$ transformation to yield features with normal distributions across subjects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we can compute similarities on these new *features* by calculating the correlation of subject $i$ and subject $j$. We can get a measure of identifiability for a subject $i$ through calculating the correlation of their features with every other subject's session 2 data (including themselves!). A successful identification occurs when the correlations are maximized when they are *within-subject rather than across subject*. The accuracy score of this *fingerprinting analysis* is yielded by examining the proportion of subjects that are successfully identifiable (within correlation $\\gt$ across-correlation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not the only way of calculating identifiability - different methods exist that yield different perspectives, and some do a better job than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that part of the fingerprinting process yields similarity scores between individuals which may yield useful insights to how individuals may relate to each other. Do individuals with \"similar fingerprints\" share similar cognitive/behavioural profiles? Do psychiatric conditions interact with fingerprinting reliability? \n",

    "- Which edges (connections) contributed most to your fingerprinting accuracy score? Look to the paper for ideas on how to tackle this question\n",
    "- Try other volume-based parcellation schemes. What effects do parcellations have on fingerprinting? Is there something you can say about parcellation structure that relates to fingerprinting accuracy? \n",
    "    - HINT: Read the papers that generated the parcellations, what sort of information went inside the parcellation scheme? \n",
