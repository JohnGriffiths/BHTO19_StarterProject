***Project Organizer Notes***

Plan for this project: 

Basically, we will list a number of new tasks based off the things done in the edu course, which will use 

[this repo](https://github.com/josephmje/scwg2018_python_neuroimaging/blob/master/bin/07_functional-connectivity-analysis_solutions.ipynb)

so check out the repo contents and start listing ideas as issues


To do: 

- get+add the link(s) for the educational project(s) repo(s)
- make decisions re: data availability+access, if important
- build out issues list with lots of handholding
- replace this list with a readme for people
- change the name?


Ideas:
- Fingerprinting on control subjects vs SCZ -- do psychiatric conditions affect how well we can fingerprint
